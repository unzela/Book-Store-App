He could not believe it when the beautiful Adira actually began to reciprocate, falling in love with him for his simplicity and honesty. Slowly, as they get close and comfortable with each other, life takes on another hue. From truly magical it becomes routine. There are fights and then making-up sessions-a clash of egos and doubts.Things begin to change for the worst.It is too late.Ronnie and Adira will probably never find their forever after . . .',

      description: "'You Are The Best Wife: A True Love Story' is a story about how people find true love and comfort in dissimilarities; about how two people with absolutely different ideologies meet and fall in love. The story revolves around Bhavna and Ajay. Bhavna loves living life for others while Ajay loves living for himself; Bhavna is more spontaneous, never planning the next move and living life with the flow. On the other hand, living life without planning a single move is almost blasphemous to Ajay. Yet, they fall in love; they get married and love changes both of them for good. However, destiny had some other plans for this couple in love; and, midway through their happiness, Bhavna had to resign from life. But does this halt mean the end of love? Written in frank and clear words with generous dosage of humor, 'You Are the Best Wife' is hailed as a true love story amidst all adversities. It is an inspiring and bittersweet tale of a youth that metamorphoses into a whole new being after being touched by love.",

And did I tell you my family is a bit, well, traditional? Anyway, leave that. Zara and I broke up four years ago. She moved on in life. I didn't. I drank every night to forget her. I called, messaged, and stalked her on social media. She just ignored me. However, that night, on the eve of her birthday, Zara messaged me. She called me over, like old times, to her hostel room 105. I shouldn't have gone, but I didâ€¦ and my life changed forever. This is not a love story. It is an unlove story.",
